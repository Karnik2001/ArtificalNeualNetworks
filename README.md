# Artifical Neural Networks Projects
These are projects that I created during my Al Software Engineer Internship at Resilience Inc. The projects were part of my training and samples of futrue projects for the organization. I used a mix of CNN and ANN systems to create predictions and detections upon the datasets I used during my internship.
